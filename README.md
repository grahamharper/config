# Config

Config is a basic checklist I follow to set up a new Mac's development environment. It's based on [Mark Otto's config](https://github.com/mdo/config).

## Checklist

1. Prep OS X
  * Download and install latest version of Xcode from the Mac App Store
  * Download and install Xcode command line tools

2. Download dependancies
  * Install [Homebrew](http://brew.sh)
  * Install Node `brew install node`

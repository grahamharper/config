# Config

Config is a basic checklist I follow to set up a new Mac's development environment. It's based on [Mark Otto's config](https://github.com/mdo/config). It's a WIP.

## Checklist

### 1. Prep OS X
  * Download and install latest version of Xcode from the Mac App Store
  * Download and install Xcode command line tools

### 2. Download dependancies
  * Install [Homebrew](http://brew.sh)
  * Install Node `brew install node`

### 3. Secure Git(Hub) access

  - [Generate new SSH key](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys/)
  - [Generate an access token](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-access-token-for-command-line-use/) for Terminal to auth your GitHub account when 2FA is enabled
